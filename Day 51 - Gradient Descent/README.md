## Gradient Descent Algorithm

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost or loss function by iteratively updating the parameters (such as coefficients or weights) of a model. In the context of simple linear regression, gradient descent can be used to find the optimal values of the slope ($m$) and the y-intercept ($b$) that minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values of the response variable.

### Mathematical Formulation:

In simple linear regression, the objective is to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted ($`\hat{Y}_i`$) and actual ($Y_i$) values of the response variable:
$`$` \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2 `$`$

To achieve this, we define a cost function $J(m, b)$ that represents the MSE:
$`$` J(m, b) = \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - (mx_i + b))^2 `$`$

Where:
- $m$ is the slope,
- $b$ is the y-intercept,
- $x_i$ is the predictor variable for the $i$-th data point,
- $Y_i$ is the actual response variable for the $i$-th data point,
- $\hat{Y}_i$ is the predicted response variable for the $i$-th data point,
- $n$ is the number of data points.

### Gradient Descent Algorithm:

Gradient descent updates the parameters ($m$ and $b$) iteratively in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function $J(m, b)$. It uses the partial derivatives of $J(m, b)$ with respect to $m$ and $b$ to determine the direction of the update.

1. **Initialize Parameters:**
   - Start with initial values for $m$ and $b$ (e.g., $m = 0$ and $b = 0$).

2. **Compute Gradients:**
   - Compute the partial derivatives of the cost function $J(m, b)$ with respect to $m$ and $b$:
   $`$` \frac{\partial J}{\partial m} = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i (Y_i - (mx_i + b)) `$`$
   $`$` \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - (mx_i + b)) `$`$

3. **Update Parameters:**
   - Update the parameters $m$ and $b$ using the gradients and a learning rate ($\alpha$):
   $`$` m := m - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial m} `$`$
   $`$` b := b - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} `$`$

4. **Iterate:**
   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the cost function converges to a minimum or a predefined number of iterations is reached.

### Interpretation:

- The learning rate ($\alpha$) controls the step size of each parameter update. It is a hyperparameter that needs to be chosen carefully, as a too large or too small learning rate can lead to convergence issues.
- The update rules move the parameters in the direction that reduces the cost function, gradually approaching the optimal values of $m$ and $b$ that minimize the MSE.

### Summary:

Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function (MSE) by updating the parameters (slope $m$ and y-intercept $b$) of a simple linear regression model. By iteratively adjusting the parameters in the direction of steepest descent, gradient descent converges to the optimal values that minimize the MSE and provide the best-fit line for the given dataset.
