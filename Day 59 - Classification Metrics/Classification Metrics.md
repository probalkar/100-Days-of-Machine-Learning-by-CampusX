## Classification Metrics

In classification problems, accuracy and confusion matrix are important metrics used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. Let's delve into each of these metrics in detail:

### Accuracy:

Accuracy is a straightforward metric that measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances in the dataset. Mathematically, accuracy is calculated as:

$ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}} \times 100\% $

### Confusion Matrix:

A confusion matrix is a tabular representation that summarizes the performance of a classification model on a dataset by displaying the counts of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions. It helps in understanding the types of errors made by the model and provides insights into its performance. The confusion matrix is typically presented as follows:

|                  | Predicted Positive (1) | Predicted Negative (0) |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Actual Positive (1) | True Positive (TP)     | False Negative (FN)    |
| Actual Negative (0) | False Positive (FP)    | True Negative (TN)     |

#### Definitions:
- **True Positive (TP):** Instances correctly predicted as positive.
- **True Negative (TN):** Instances correctly predicted as negative.
- **False Positive (FP):** Instances incorrectly predicted as positive (Type I error).
- **False Negative (FN):** Instances incorrectly predicted as negative (Type II error).

### Evaluation Metrics Derived from Confusion Matrix:

1. **Precision:** Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all instances predicted as positive. It's calculated as:

   $ \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} $

2. **Recall (Sensitivity):** Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances. It's calculated as:

   $ \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} $

3. **F1 Score:** The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. It's calculated as:

   $ \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} $

4. **Specificity:** Specificity measures the proportion of true negative predictions among all actual negative instances. It's calculated as:

   $ \text{Specificity} = \frac{TN}{TN + FP} $

5. **Accuracy:** Accuracy, as mentioned earlier, measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.

### Interpretation:

- **High Accuracy:** A high accuracy indicates that the model performs well overall in making correct predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis:** A detailed analysis of the confusion matrix helps in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses, such as its ability to correctly identify positive and negative instances and its susceptibility to Type I and Type II errors.
- **Trade-offs:** Evaluation metrics derived from the confusion matrix, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, provide insights into the trade-offs between different aspects of model performance.

## Python Implementation
In Python, scikit-learn provides functions to calculate accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for both binary and multi-class classification problems. Here's how to use these functions along with macro average and weighted average for multi-class classification:

### 1. Accuracy:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# True labels and predicted labels
y_true = [...]
y_pred = [...]

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

### 2. Confusion Matrix:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Calculate confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", conf_matrix)
```

### 3. Classification Report:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Generate classification report
class_report = classification_report(y_true, y_pred)
print("Classification Report:\n", class_report)
```

### 4. Macro Average and Weighted Average:

To calculate macro average and weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score in the classification report, use the `average` parameter:

```python
# Calculate macro average and weighted average
class_report_macro_avg = classification_report(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')
class_report_weighted_avg = classification_report(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')

print("Macro Average Classification Report:\n", class_report_macro_avg)
print("Weighted Average Classification Report:\n", class_report_weighted_avg)
```

- **Macro Average:** Computes metrics for each class independently and then takes the unweighted average of the measures.
- **Weighted Average:** Computes metrics for each class independently and then takes the average weighted by the number of true instances for each class.

By using these functions and parameters in scikit-learn, you can easily calculate accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, including macro average and weighted average, for both binary and multi-class classification problems.

### Summary:

Accuracy and confusion matrix, along with derived evaluation metrics, are essential tools for evaluating the performance of classification models. They help in assessing the model's ability to make correct predictions and provide valuable insights into its strengths and weaknesses.
